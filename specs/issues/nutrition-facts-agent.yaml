  Focused lookup agent for product nutrition data.

  ## Purpose

  Takes product names (commercial or generic), returns macros.
  Used by Nutrition Planning skill to calculate fuel needs.

  ## Capabilities

  - [ ] Look up commercial products (Clif Bar, GU gel, Skratch mix)
  - [ ] Estimate macros for generic items (cookie, PB&J, banana)
  - [ ] Return structured data: calories, carbs, protein, fat, serving size
  - [ ] Indicate confidence level (exact vs. estimated)

  ## Data Sources

  - [ ] USDA FoodData Central API
  - [ ] OpenFoodFacts database
  - [ ] Curated database of cycling-specific products

  ## Example Usage

  ```
  Input: "Clif Bar Chocolate Chip"
  Output: { calories: 250, carbs: 44, protein: 10, fat: 5, confidence: "exact" }

  Input: "chocolate chip cookie"
  Output: { calories: 150, carbs: 20, protein: 2, fat: 7, confidence: "estimated" }
  ```

  ## Notes

  This is a sub-agent, not a skill. It's stateless and doesn't need
  route context - just the product query.
