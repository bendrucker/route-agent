body: |
  User needs to provide real-world data to make evals assess the agent on realistic tasks.

  ## Strava History Fixtures

  Export sample ride data that represents typical usage patterns:

  - **Recent rides** (last 3-6 months): JSON/GPX exports showing:
    - Typical route distances (80-100 mile range)
    - Elevation profiles
    - Preferred road types
    - Frequent starting locations
  - **Segment data**: Favorite climbs, PR segments
  - **Format**: Anonymized if needed, but preserve route characteristics

  ### What this enables

  - History Analysis skill can pattern-match on real preferences
  - Route Optimization can reference actual past routes
  - Evals can verify agent finds patterns in your riding style

  ## Route Query Test Cases

  Provide 3-5 example queries you would actually ask, with expected outputs:

  ### Format per query

  ```yaml
  query: "Plan a century ride from Palo Alto to Santa Cruz via the coast"
  context:
    season: summer
    fitness_level: high
    time_constraints: "start by 7am, finish by 4pm"
  expected:
    skills_invoked:
      - History Analysis
      - Climb Planning
      - Weather Planning
      - Food Stop Planning
      - Water Stop Planning
    key_decisions:
      - "Should suggest Highway 1 vs inland route based on wind"
      - "Should identify Page Mill or OLH as climb options"
      - "Should recommend water stops every 20-25 miles"
    output_characteristics:
      - "GPX file with turn-by-turn"
      - "Nutrition plan for 5000+ calories"
      - "Clothing recommendation for fog → sun transition"
  ```

  ## Nutrition Preferences

  List your actual on-bike nutrition choices so evals can verify agent suggests appropriate options:

  - Preferred commercial products (gels, bars, chews)
  - Homemade options you use
  - Foods you avoid (allergies, preferences)
  - Hydration preferences (plain water, electrolytes, specific brands)

  ## Clothing Inventory

  What gear do you actually own? Agent should recommend from realistic options:

  - Base layers, jerseys, jackets
  - Arm/leg warmers, vests
  - Storage options (saddle bag, jersey pockets)

  ## Geographic Context

  Where do you ride? Agent needs local knowledge:

  - Primary riding area (e.g., SF Bay Area)
  - Known routes and their characteristics
  - Favorite climbs with typical conditions
  - Reliable food/water stops you use

  ## Deliverables

  - [ ] Strava history export (anonymized GPX/JSON)
  - [ ] 3-5 route query test cases with expected outputs
  - [ ] Nutrition product list with preferences
  - [ ] Clothing inventory
  - [ ] Geographic context notes
