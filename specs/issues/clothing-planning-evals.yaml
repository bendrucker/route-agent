  Skill-level evals for Clothing Planning.

  ## Test Scenarios

  ### Cold Start, Warm Midday

  ```yaml
  - vars:
      start_temp_f: 45
      end_temp_f: 72
      elevation_gain_ft: 4000
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: |
          Should recommend:
          - Arm warmers or removable sleeves
          - Storage for removed layers
          - Consider warmth from climbing
  ```

  ### Large Temperature Swing

  ```yaml
  - vars:
      start_temp_f: 40
      end_temp_f: 75
      duration_hours: 6
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: |
          Should recommend:
          - Saddle bag for storage
          - Multiple removable layers
          - Plan for transitions
  ```

  ### Minimal Layers

  ```yaml
  - vars:
      start_temp_f: 68
      end_temp_f: 70
      duration_hours: 2
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: |
          Should recommend:
          - Light kit, minimal layers
          - No bag needed
  ```

  ## Deliverables

  - [ ] Create promptfooconfig.yaml for clothing-planning skill
  - [ ] Add 5+ temperature scenario test cases
  - [ ] Use llm-rubric for subjective quality
  - [ ] All tests passing

  ## Notes

  Use `llm-rubric` assertion type since clothing recommendations
  are subjective - we're checking for reasoning quality, not exact matches.
