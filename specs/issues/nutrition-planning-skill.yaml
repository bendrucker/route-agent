body: |
  Plan calorie consumption and on-bike fueling strategy.

  ## Capabilities

  - [ ] Calculate total calorie burn (distance, elevation, terrain, weather)
  - [ ] Estimate consumption rate per hour
  - [ ] Identify high-effort sections (climbs, headwinds)
  - [ ] Plan food stop timing for real food consumption
  - [ ] Plan on-bike nutrition for sections between stops
  - [ ] Consider fuel type by terrain:
    - Whole foods for steady efforts
    - Gels/chews for intense climbing
    - Drink mixes for sustained calories
  - [ ] Output packing list with consumption schedule

  ## Domain Knowledge to Encode

  | Fuel Type | Best For | Notes |
  |-----------|----------|-------|
  | Whole foods | Long steady sections | Eat at stops or easy terrain |
  | Energy bars | Moderate efforts | Can eat while riding |
  | Gels/chews | Intense efforts | Fast absorption |
  | Drink mix | Sustained effort | Continuous calorie intake |

  ## Integration

  Works with Food Stop Planning skill - that skill finds where to stop,
  this skill calculates what you need and when to consume it.
