  - Implement Weather Planning skill

body: |
  Match clothing choices to weather conditions throughout the ride.

  ## Capabilities

  - [ ] Get weather by segment from Weather Planning
  - [ ] Identify temperature range (start vs. midday vs. end)
  - [ ] Consider effort level effects (climbing warms you up)
  - [ ] Plan layering strategy:
    - Base layer needs
    - Mid-layer options
    - Outer layer for wind/rain
  - [ ] Plan for transitions:
    - What to remove and when
    - Storage requirements (jersey pockets vs. bag)
  - [ ] Suggest specific gear types based on conditions

  ## Domain Knowledge to Encode

  | Condition | Gear Considerations |
  |-----------|---------------------|
  | Cold start, warm midday | Short sleeve + removable jacket, arm warmers |
  | Large temp swing (> 20°F) | Consider saddle bag for storage |
  | Variable conditions | Packable wind vest |
  | Descent after climb | Keep warm layer accessible |
  | Arm/leg warmers | Ideal for 50-65°F, easy to remove |
  | Knee warmers | Protect joints in cool temps |
  | Shoe covers | Below 50°F or wet conditions |

  ## Layering Logic

  - Start slightly cold (you'll warm up)
  - Plan to shed layers within first 30 min
  - Heavier layers for descents after climbs
  - Extremities (hands, feet, ears) matter most

  ## Notes

  Agent doesn't know user's exact wardrobe - provides guidance on
  weight/type of clothing and specific cycling gear options.
