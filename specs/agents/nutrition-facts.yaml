notes: |
  This agent doesn't need route context - it just takes a product name
  and returns nutrition data. The Nutrition Planning skill handles the
  complex reasoning about when/where to consume different foods.

  For cycling-specific products (gels, bars, drink mixes), maintain a
  curated database of common items for faster, more accurate lookups.
